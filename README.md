# Weather-Dash-GR

I started off with making the HTML file and started to style it with bootstrap along with a css file for further adjustments.
 I used a picture of dots as placeholders for the five day forcast, also placed placeholders for the main data that i'm about to plug in.
 I used the "https://openweathermap.org/" for the API.
 I called the Current Weather API, the One Call API and I pulled the discription images from 'openweathermap'.
 I grabbed the data for the API for the current weather and the five day forcast.
 Then I plugged the data into my html and named the data accordingly.
 when the user types the city name, the name is listed and is able to be click on to retrieve searched data.
 There is a clear button that will clear all searched data.
 The current UV is colored with blue for favorable , green for moderate and red for severe conditions.
